Reservation Process
👤 Employee
1.	The employee logs into the application and sees the list of available equipment. They can also use the search bar to filter and find the equipment they need.
2.	They select a specific piece of equipment (e.g., “Camera Machine No. 3”). Multiple items can be selected.
3.	They specify the reservation period. When placing a reservation, the system shows a form containing:
• 📅 Pickup date and time
• 📅 Return date and time
4.	They click the “Request Reservation” button.
5.	They write the purpose of use, meaning what the equipment will be used for.
Example: Project: “Q4 Advertising Campaign”
6.	The system automatically checks:
• Whether the equipment is available
• Whether there is any conflict with another reservation
7.	If no conflict exists, a notification appears:
“Your request has been sent for approval.”

🧑‍💼 Administrator
1.	The administrator logs into the dashboard and sees all new requests (status = pending).
2.	They open each request and see:
• Employee name
• The requested reservation period
• Purpose of use (the admin can verify that the equipment is required for an actual registered project and not for personal purposes)
3.	Upon approval:
• The status becomes approved
• Notifications are sent to the employee via email and the website:
“Your request to reserve Camera Machine from October 10 to 12 has been approved.”
All reservation requests appear to the administrator sorted by timestamp in milliseconds — the oldest request appears first.

Checkout (Receiving the Equipment)
👤 Employee
Step 3: When receiving the items, the employee clicks on “Receive Equipment” in the application.
1.	A receipt card appears showing:
• Project name
• List of reserved equipment
• Scheduled pickup and return date/time
• A final confirmation button: “Confirm Equipment Pickup”
2.	After clicking the button, an optional comment field appears:
“Equipment received in good condition.”
3.	Then they click “Confirm Pickup”.
The system updates the equipment status to In Use.
Notifications are sent to the administrator:
“The equipment has been received by [Employee Name] at the specified location.”

Return Process
👤 Employee
1.	After finishing the usage, the employee returns the equipment to the storage room.
🧑‍💼 Administrator
1.	The administrator scans the equipment using the barcode/QR scanner; the status instantly changes to In Storage, and the employee receives a notification confirming the return.
2.	The administrator inspects the equipment manually (condition, cleanliness, functionality).
3.	The return process must only occur through actual scanning, not from the list, to ensure the equipment is physically present.
4.	The system asks the admin to confirm the condition:
1.	Is the equipment in good condition? ✅
2.	Are there any notes? (Yes / No)
If yes, the administrator writes the notes.
